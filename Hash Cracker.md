# My thoughts
## Hello Hash Function! Who are you?

Hash is a name of a chef....no no, but hash knows how to make unique recipes by taking a file, text, or password, and transforms it into a unique, fixed-length string of characters called a "hash value" or "hash".

This means hash value should be intact...if it is not, someone changes something in the file, text, password. 

In CIA triad, hash belongs to the Intergity team :). However, not every hash function is secure. For example, MD5 is an old hash function and is easy to crack. 

If you do not believe that, look at what I did to MD5 that I found in the VM.

After the crack, the password I found out was simple. It's time to change our password. Be more complex and noteasyguess please!!!
